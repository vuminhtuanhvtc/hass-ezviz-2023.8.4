# Ezviz Custom Component for Home Assistant

This is a custom component for the Ezviz integration, based on the Home Assistant 2023.8.4 version. It is intended for users who prefer the functionality and compatibility of the Ezviz integration from version 2023.8.4, allowing it to run on newer versions of Home Assistant.

## Purpose

2. Place the `ezviz` folder in your `config/custom_components` directory in Home Assistant.
3. Restart Home Assistant to load the custom component.
4. Add the Ezviz integration as usual in the Integrations section of Home Assistant.

## Note
This custom component is based on Home Assistant 2023.8.4 and is maintained to work with later versions of Home Assistant for users who prefer the original functionality.
